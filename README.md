### Craiglsist Website
This website was create by Liudas Panavas  for CS5610 Web Development at Northeastern (https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_fall_2020/)

### Objective
The objective of this website was to create an express and Mongodb and backend with a React front end. The Backend handles the different users and party locations and the React front end makes the webpage dynamic. We noticed that it is difficult to find a party venue location for various types of people on google maps. This website allows you to find a place in your area and browse exlusively party venues. Also different users can comment on the website and say if they liked it.

Hi,Liudas.Amazing work i really like it!
For you project, I really like the login page, the search design and the detailed page when I open a card, that is awesome.
Two nitpicks, one is about the spacing and aligining among cards and the other is about likes feature, I still didn't figure out how to "like" a post.
